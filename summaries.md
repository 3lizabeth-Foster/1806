Prerequisites: 18.02 is considered a prerequisite for 18.06.  We believe that students should have a little familiarity with multiplying matrices, matrix times vector, and perhaps partial derivatives.

# Spring 2019 [18.06](https://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/) Lecture Summaries <br>
 [Prof. Alan Edelman](http://math.mit.edu/~edelman)

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.

(You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Fall 2017](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/fall17/summaries.md) and [Spring 2018](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/spring18/summaries.md).)
