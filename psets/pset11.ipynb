    "**(a)** Suppose that $A$ is an $m \\times m$ matrix, and $A + A^H$ is *positive-definite*.   It follows that any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $A$ must have a positive *real part* — why?   (Hint: suppose $Ax=\\lambda x$ and plug the eigenvector $x$ into $x^H (A + A^H) x$, which must be \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.)\n",

With the help of your answer from (a), using *no numerical calculation*, explain why you would expect the resulting vector to grow, decay to zero, oscillate forever, or approach a nonzero steady state (pick one)?
