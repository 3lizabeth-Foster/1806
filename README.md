This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.  (You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Spring 2022](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/spring22/README.md).)

## Lecture 1 (Sep 7)

* [course overview/syllabus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ivbV1nr67XfasBdXezZF9UWILzDoQtQev8vSqRKBfu0/edit?usp=sharing)
* pset 1: to be posted, due **Friday Sep 16 at 11am** (submit your solutions on Gradescope).
* video: see *recordings* link above.

Slides giving the syllabus and the "big picture" of what 18.06 is about.  Introduction to thinking about matrices as linear operations, not just as "bags of numbers".

**Further reading**: Strang, chapter 1, and section 8.1 on linear transformations.  3blue1brown has a nice video on [matrix multiplication as composition of linear transformations](https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU).  If you've forgotten the basics of how to multiply matrices by vectors or matrices by matrices, google for some tutorial material online (e.g. [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices)) and do a quick brush-up.

## *Optional* Julia Tutorial (Monday Sep 12 @ 5pm): [Zoom](https://mit.zoom.us/j/97099588467?pwd=bGVNOXFqdzhZRjVnRjRLeE1qNFNpdz09)

* video recording: to be posted

A basic overview of the Julia programming environment for numerical computations that we will use in 18.06 for simple computational exploration.   This (Zoom-based) tutorial will cover what Julia is and the basics of interaction, scalar/vector/matrix arithmetic, and plotting — we'll be using it as just a "fancy calculator" and no "real programming" will be required.

If possible, try to install Julia on your laptop beforehand using the instructions at the above link.  Failing that, you can run Julia in the cloud (see instructions above).
