Welcome to MIT 18.06: Linear Algebra! Spring 2023 course information, materials, and links are recorded below. Course materials for previous semesters are archived in the [other branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) of this repository. You can dive in right away by reading about a new start to this course in the [course introduction](https://github.com/mitmath/1806/blob/master/notes/Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Algebra%206th%20edition%20and%20A%20%3D%20CR_04.pdf).

Catalog Description: *Basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing topics useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, singular value decomposition, and positive definite matrices. Applications to least-squares approximations, stability of differential equations, networks, Fourier transforms, and Markov processes. Uses linear algebra software. Compared with 18.700, more emphasis on matrix algorithms and many applications.*
