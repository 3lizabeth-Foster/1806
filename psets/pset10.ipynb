    "In the [18.06 ODE lecture](https://nbviewer.org/github/mitmath/1806/blob/master/notes/ODEs.ipynb), we found that the position ($x$) and velocity ($v) of a mass bouncing on a spring without friction are described by the equations:\n",

    "**(b)** For *any* anti-Hermitian $B = -B^H$, the matrix $iB$ is a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ matrix because $(iB)^H = \\_\\_\\_$.   It follows that the eigenvalues of $B$ are purely \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and hence the solutions $\\vec{y}(t)$ of $d\\vec{y}/dt = B \\vec{y}$ are \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (oscillating/growing/decaying).\n",

From this, derive that the solution $$\\vec{y}(t) = e^{Bt} \\vec{y}(0)$$ for your $B$ from part (a) *conserves energy*: $\\frac{1}{2} mv^2 + \\frac{1}{2} kx^2$ (kinetic + potential energy) is a *constant* as a function of time $t$."
