    "Suppose $A$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, $B$ is a $3 \\times 2$ matrix, $x$ is a 3-component column vector, and $y$ is a $2$-component column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the **shape** of the output (e.g. scalar, $4\\times 3$ matrix, 5-component column vector, etcetera) of the following operations, or say **nonsense** if the operation doesn't make sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. $3\\times 2$ matrix: 2 components in (to $B$) are then fed into $A$, which spits 3 components out, so this process is $\\mathrm(3 outputs) \\times (2 inputs)$ and hence a $3 \\times 2$ matrix\n",
    "2. nonsense: $BA$ feeds the outputs of $A$ (3 components) into the input of $B$ (which expects 2 components)\n",
    "3. $3$-component column vector: $y$ feeds into $B$, which spits out 3 components, which are fed into $A$, which spits out 3 components\n",
    "4. nonsense: $Ax$ is a 3-component vector, but you can't multiply a column vector by a matrix $B$ on the right.   (You *could* do $(Ax)^T B$, which would yield a 2-component row vector.)\n",
    "5. nonsense: $Ay$ doesn't make sense, since $y$ has 2 components and $A$ expects 2 inputs.\n",
    "6. scalar: this is the dot product of $x$ with the 3-component vector $By$.\n",
    "7. nonsense: you can't take the dot product of a 3-component vector witha  2-component vector.\n",
    "8. $2 \\times 3$ matrix.  You can think of this as the linear operator that first takes a dot product with $x$, and then scales $y$ by this factor.  You also get the same $2 \\times 3$ matrix if you apply the \"rows-times-columns\" matrix-multiplication rule, treating $y$ as a \"1-column matrix\" and $x^T$ as a \"1-row matrix\".  (In applied linear algebra, we often gloss over the distinction between a column/row vectors and 1-column/1-row matrices.  Here is a [video on this glossing-over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2RO34b_oPM) with more detail than you probably want.)\n",
    "9. nonsense. Multiplication of a column vector by a column vector is not a standard operation in linear algebra.   (One can *define* some rule here, but then you need a more explicit notation to denote *which* kind of product you want.  For example, it's quite common to want an *elementwise* or \"Hadamard\" product of two column vectors, but this normally uses a special multiplication symbol, e.g. $x \\odot x$, or `x .* x` in Julia.)\n",
    "10. $3\\times 3$ matrix: $A^2$ is just the linear operator that applies $A$ twice, which is perfectly sensible since the inputs and outputs of $A$ are both 3-component vectors.\n",
    "11. nonsense: $B^2$ would apply $B$ twice, but the outputs of $B$ are 3-component vectors while its inputs are 2-component vectors, so there's no way to feed the outputs of $B$ back into another application of $B$.\n",
    "12. nonsense.   Later in the course, we will see that $A^{-1} x$ *is* meaningful (also denoted `A \\ x` in Julia or Matlab), but you can only multiply a column vector by a matrix inverse on the *left*, while the notation $\\frac{x}{A}$ is ambiguous about whether we are \"dividing\" on the left or right.  We have to keep left vs. right crystal clear when working with non-commutative things like matrices, unlike real numbers!\n",
    "13. nonsense.  Just like $x^2$ above, we can't divide vectors by vectors.  (Sometimes…not really in 18.06…you may want *elementwise* division of column vectors, but you need a special symbol for this like `x ./ y` in Julia.)"

    "(From Strang, section 2.2, problem 11.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A system of linear equations Ax=b cannot have exactly two solutions. An easy way to see why: if two vectors x and y≠x are two solutions (i.e. Ax=b and Ay=b), what is another solution? (Hint: x+y is almost right.)\n",

    "For example, $\\boxed{\\frac{x+y}{2}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, we could start with hint: let's consider $x+y$, which would us $A(x+y)=Ax+Ay=b+b=2b$. This is *almost* what we want but not quite a solution, since we get $2b$ rather than $b$. We fix it by dividing by $2$ to get $A\\left(\\frac{x+y}{2}\\right)=A\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)+A\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}Ax+\\frac{1}{2}Ay=\\frac{b}{2}+\\frac{b}{2}=b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key factor here is the **linearity** of $A$, which allows us to distribute $A$ through vector-addition and scalar-multiplication operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More generally, we could see that $\\boxed{\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)y}$ is a solution for *any* real number $\\alpha$, since $A[\\alpha x + (1-\\alpha)y] = \\alpha Ax + (1-\\alpha) Ay = \\alpha b + (1-\\alpha) b = b$ by linearity.  That means, as soon as a linear equation has two distinct solutions, it must have *infinitely many solutions*.  (We will spend a lot of time on this later in 18.06, because it's quite important in practice.)\n",
