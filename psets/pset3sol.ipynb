    "### Part (a): \n",
    "\n",
    "We claim that $\\boxed{C(AB) \\subseteq C(A)}$: any vector in $C(AB)$ is of the form $ABx$, and setting $y=Bx$ we see that $ABx=Ay\\in C(A)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, $C(A)$ is not necessarily subset of $C(AB)$, in other words, the inclusion $C(AB)\\subset C(A)$ proved above might be strict. This happens when $C(B)$ is too small and the vectors $Ay$ for $y\\in C(B)$ are not enough to obtain all potential outputs of $A$. As a simple example of this situation we can take any non-zero matrix $A$ (for example, $2\\times 2$ identity matrix) and take $B=0$. Then $AB=0$ so $C(AB)=0$ is zero-dimensional, but $C(A)$ has at least dimension one. \n",

    "### Part (b):\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an example of matrix $A$ note that $C(A^2)$ consists of all vectors obtained by application of $A$ to $C(A)$, so if we want $C(A^2)$ to have lower dimension than $C(A)$, the operator $A$ should send the space $C(A)$ to a strictly smaller space. This is only possible if $A$ \"merges\" some vectors from $C(A)$ together, that is, if $Ax=Ay$ for different vectors $x,y$ from $C(A)$. The latter implies that $x-y\\neq 0$ is both in $C(A)$ and $N(A)$, so to have $C(A^2)$ smaller than $C(A)$ the dimension of intersection $N(A)\\cap C(A)$ should be non-zero ($N(A)\\cap C(A)$ is not a vector space consisting only of $0$ element).\n",

    "Let us first explain a way to find such a matrix $A$. Since the solutions form a line in $\\mathbb R^3$, the input is from $\\mathbb R^3$ and the matrix $A$ must have three columns. Recall that $Ax=b$ is solvable if $C(A)$ contains $b$, and the set of all solutions has the form $x+N(A)$, where $x$ is any solution of $Ax=b$. So, if solutions of $Ax=b$ form a line, $N(A)$ must have dimension $1$. Finally, recall that row operations do not change $N(A)$. This gives us a following plan for finding $A,b$ as in the problem: we start with a matrix $A^{tmp}$ having only $1$ free column and $2$ pivot columns, so the dimension of $N(A^{tmp})$ is $1$, then we perform row operations to get a matrix $A$ with all entries being nonzero and then pick $b$ from $C(A)$. \n",
