# MIT Course 18.06, Fall 2022

This is a repository for the course [18.06: Linear Algebra](http://web.mit.edu/18.06) at MIT in Fall 2022.   See [other branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) of this repository for previous semesters.

**Instructor**: [Prof. Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj).  Course administrator: TBA

**Lectures**: MWF11 in 34-101.  Video recordings and handwritten notes to be posted online, along with other materials (slides, further reading) posted below.

**Exams**: 11am in 34-101, dates TBA.  Final exam: TBA.

**Recitations**:
Instructors TBA.

**Undergraduate Assistants**: TBA.

**Resources**: Piazza discussion forum TBA, [math learning center](https://math.mit.edu/learningcenter/), [TSR^2 study/resource room](https://ome.mit.edu/programs/talented-scholars-resource-room-tsr2), [pset partners](https://psetpartners.mit.edu/).

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.  (You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Spring 2022](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/spring22/README.md).)

## Lecture 1 (Sep 7)

* [course overview/syllabus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ivbV1nr67XfasBdXezZF9UWILzDoQtQev8vSqRKBfu0/edit?usp=sharing)
* pset 1: to be posted, due **Friday Sep 16 at 11am** (submit your solutions on Gradescope).
* video: see *recordings* link above.

Slides giving the syllabus and the "big picture" of what 18.06 is about.  Introduction to thinking about matrices as linear operations, not just as "bags of numbers".

**Further reading**: Strang, chapter 1, and section 8.1 on linear transformations.  3blue1brown has a nice video on [matrix multiplication as composition of linear transformations](https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU).  If you've forgotten the basics of how to multiply matrices by vectors or matrices by matrices, google for some tutorial material online (e.g. [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices)) and do a quick brush-up.
