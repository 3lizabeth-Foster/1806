    "In this class we may not prove the SVD exists, or even teach you how to calculate it.  It is your professor's pedagogical belief that every student someday should learn to prove it exists, or even how it is calculated numerically, but not necessarily in an introductory class.  I would rather you learned how to interpret it and over the course of the semester see all the things it is good for, and there is only so much time in a semester. Feel free to tell me a) good plan I believe you or b) good plan, I might look up the computation some day or c) bad plan, I just got to calculate a small case, or I just can't believe it.  (No wrong answer here, I expect all answers.)"
