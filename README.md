# MIT Course 18.06, Spring 2022

This is a repository for the course [18.06: Linear Algebra](http://web.mit.edu/18.06) at MIT in Spring 2022.   See [other branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) of this repository for previous semesters.

**Instructor**: [Prof. Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj).

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.  (You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Fall 2018](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/fall18/summaries.md).)

## Lecture 1 (Jan 31)

Went over the slides giving the syllabus and the "big picture" of what 18.06 is about.
