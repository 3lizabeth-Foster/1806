# MIT Course 18.06, Spring 2022

This is a repository for the course [18.06: Linear Algebra](http://web.mit.edu/18.06) at MIT in Spring 2022.   See [other branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository) of this repository for previous semesters.

**Instructor**: [Prof. Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj).

**Resources**: [Piazza discussion forum](https://piazza.com/mit/spring2022/1806), [math learning center](https://math.mit.edu/learningcenter/), [TSR^2 study/resource room](https://ome.mit.edu/programs/talented-scholars-resource-room-tsr2), [pset partners](https://psetpartners.mit.edu/).

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.  (You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Fall 2018](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/fall18/summaries.md).)

* pset 0: coming soon, due **Friday Feb 4 at 11am** (submit your solutions on Canvas).

Slides giving the syllabus and the "big picture" of what 18.06 is about.  Introduction to thinking about matrices as linear operations, not just as "bags of numbers".
